# sky-cogs
cogs for redbot v3 -other authors work as well as mine. These work for what i want/use them for, they may very well not work for you..... :D


Credit to # Flame#2941 for listmaker, thanks a ton.
Credit to # DRAPER for Pokegram!!! thanks!

Any cog from any other creator here has only been added to this repo for slight modifications here and there to make them work for the DittoBOT Official server or braches (discord.gg/ditto) 
The creators are still listed in each cogs info.json ive just been to lazy to round them up and put them all here.
