Optionally, scipy is required for auto-color generation commands for profile, rank, and levelup images.\n`___________________________`\nFor more information about installing, please refer to this: http://dimxxz.net/lvlsupport.html and this: https://github.com/AznStevy/Maybe-Useful-Cogs\nYou can also use `[p]lvladmin convertv2 /path/to/V2-Red-DiscordBot` to get data about existing servers settings and backgrounds.\nThis fork is maintained by aikaterna#1393 and is slightly different than Fixator10's published version.",
